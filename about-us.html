                <h1>OUR AIM</h1><br><br>
                The act of helping others, donating to charity, or volunteering your time, will give you an improved sense of wellbeing.<br>
				The knowledge that you've sacrificed time and/or money in order to help others in need or create positive change in the world is a beautiful thing.<br> 
				<br>
				<br>
                
                This website aims to increase awareness and collect funds for the needy. Each and every donation counts. <br>
				Even a small donation from our part can create a significant change in someone else's lives. <br>
